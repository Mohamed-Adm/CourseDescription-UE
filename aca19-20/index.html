            Comprehensive project spanning two semesters; students undertake an
            individual project which involves addressing a significant technical
            problem they embark on this under the guidance of a supervisor;
            students are expected to demonstrate an ability to apply the
            disciplined approaches of the course in addressing the solution to
            the problem; students produce a final thesis on the work and this
            together with a demonstration of the working system will form the
            assessment
